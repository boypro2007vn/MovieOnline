It was... alien.

00:39:21.018 --> 00:39:25.795 line:93%
A-alien, as in... unfamiliar?

00:39:27.412 --> 00:39:28.964 line:93%
No.

00:39:32.535 --> 00:39:34.536 line:93%
Wow.

00:39:34.538 --> 00:39:36.371 line:93%
The minute I learned what it was,

00:39:36.373 --> 00:39:37.872 line:93%
I tried to keep them from
injecting you with it,

00:39:37.874 --> 00:39:43.044 line:93%
but I was too late.
I'm so sorry, Skye.

00:39:43.046 --> 00:39:46.681 line:93%
You were trying to save my life.
You did save my life.

00:39:46.683 --> 00:39:49.350 line:93%
I was desperate to, and
so I subjected you

00:39:49.352 --> 00:39:51.519 line:93%
to unknown ramifications
or side effects.

00:39:51.521 --> 00:39:56.724 line:93%
I'm sorry to say this,
Sir, but... so what?

00:39:58.393 --> 00:40:01.996 line:93%
We are alive. And you've had
that stuff in you for...

00:40:01.998 --> 00:40:05.032 line:93%
uh, some time now, and
you're okay, right?

00:40:05.034 --> 00:40:07.702 line:93%
Plus, you're not sprouting
a pointy tail or anything,

00:40:07.704 --> 00:40:09.637 line:93%
so bonus there.

00:40:09.639 --> 00:40:13.140 line:93%
I know nothing fazes you,
but this should faze you.

00:40:13.142 --> 00:40:18.412 line:93%
- We are completely in the dark on this.
- That's where we live.

00:40:18.414 --> 00:40:23.183 line:93%
I'm an 0-8-4. Who knows
what the hell that means?

00:40:23.185 --> 00:40:25.352 line:93%
At least we're in
the dark together.

00:40:27.822 --> 00:40:33.126 line:93%
Yes. But not for long.

00:40:33.428 --> 00:40:38.931 line:93%
To hell with any protocols or
any code I used to be bound by.

00:40:38.933 --> 00:40:41.601 line:93%
We have a long list of
questions we need answers for,

00:40:41.603 --> 00:40:43.370 line:93%
and we're going after
them ourselves.

00:40:43.372 --> 00:40:47.206 line:93%
- Well, if the team's up for it...
- No. No, listen to me.

00:40:47.208 --> 00:40:51.378 line:93%
I trust them, but we need
to protect them from this.

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:54.247 line:93%
Fury went to dangerous lengths
to keep this under wraps...

00:40:54.249 --> 00:40:56.349 line:93%
lied to me, lied to S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:40:56.351 --> 00:40:59.685 line:93%
This is a powerful secret,
a secret men died for.

00:40:59.687 --> 00:41:03.189 line:93%
Until we know why, we can't
share this with anyone,

00:41:03.191 --> 00:41:06.225 line:93%
for their safety and ours.

00:41:10.363 --> 00:41:14.600 line:93%
Got it. So, what'll it be, A.C.?

00:41:14.602 --> 00:41:18.670 line:93%
- What do we go after first?
- The person responsible for this.

00:41:22.964 --> 00:41:25.277 line:93%
And we make him pay.

00:41:26.038 --> 00:41:27.825 line:93%

00:41:28.312 --> 00:41:29.646 line:93%
No, listen.

00:41:29.648 --> 00:41:32.149 line:93%
I trust them, but we need
to protect them from this.

00:41:32.151 --> 00:41:35.252 line:93%

Agent Melinda May. Update log 93.

00:42:05.683 --> 00:42:10.240 line:93%
He knows. I repeat...
Coulson knows.
